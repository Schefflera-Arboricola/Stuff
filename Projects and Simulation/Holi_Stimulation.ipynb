        "Holi, the festival of colours, is on its way. A bunch of kids are planning to play a water balloon game on Holi. In this game, a kid’s name is picked at random from a bowl of chits that has the names of everyone, and then everyone attacks the selected kid with one water balloon each. They want everyone’s name to be picked to ensure that the game is fair. They also want to know how many water balloons they should arrange beforehand."
